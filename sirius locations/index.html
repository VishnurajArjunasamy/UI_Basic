                        Facing unprecedented growth in the quantity and variety of data, as well as sweeping industry and
                        government regulations that dictate how that data must be managed and protected, administrators are
                        being forced to react quickly, control costs, work with limited resources, and yet implement
                        long-term storage strategies that could easily last beyond their tenure.
